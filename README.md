# Hana: Generative Art and Distributed Performance Tool
Hana (èŠ±) - Named after the Japanese word for "flower," reflecting the system's ability to let visualizations bloom across multiple displays.

Hana is a generative art and distributed visualization performance system that enables creation, control and display of visualizations across multiple screens, devices and machines.

## Documentation
[docs on github.io](https://natepiano.github.io/hana/)

## try me
```shell
git clone https://github.com/natepiano/hana.git
cd hana
cargo build --workspace
cargo run
```
we have the build --workspace to ensure the examples/basic-visualization is built before running

As of the current version, the hana binary doesn't have any much functionality yet. It allows you to launch a basic visualization in a separate process, ping it with a command that speeds up the animation and then allows you to shut down the visualization.

So that's intentional :) just shut down main hana window when you're ready to.
