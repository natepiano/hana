# Hana: Distributed Visualization Management
Hana (èŠ±) - Named after the Japanese word for "flower," reflecting the system's ability to let visualizations bloom across multiple displays.

Hana is a distributed visualization management system that enables control and display of visualizations across multiple screens, devices and machines.

## Documentation
[docs on github.io](https://natepiano.github.io/hana/)

## try me
```shell
git clone https://github.com/natepiano/hana.git
cd hana
cargo build --workspace
cargo run
```
we have the build --workspace to ensure the examples/basic-visualization is built before running

As of the current version, the hana binary doesn't have any specific functionality yet. It just launches a separate basic visualization, sends it some commands and then shuts down the visualization automatically.

When it shuts down - you'll see an blank window which is the actual hana UI that will eventually be a real UI :)

So that's intentional :) just shut down the blank window when you're ready to.
