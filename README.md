# Hana: Distributed Visualization Management
Hana (èŠ±) - Named after the Japanese word for "flower," reflecting the system's ability to let visualizations bloom across multiple displays.

Imagine a large scale music performance with video walls, lighting, lasers, and interactive visuals all in sync. You can set it up with ease, synchronize the visuals to the music, and control them with input from keyboards, microphones, sensors and apps. Play and improvise the visualizations just as you do the music - controlling color, complexity, movement, rotation, zoom, transitions and more.

Hana is a distributed visualization management system that enables control and display of visualizations across multiple screens, devices and machines.
## Overview
Built in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) using the [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine, hana consists of a management app that controls both local and remote devices (typically screens or projectors). The management app can run on multiple machines in a mesh network, with any management app instance capable of acting as a controller. The idea is that as you need additional GPUs, or you need to support local sensors or input devices, you add additional machines to the mesh.

Visualizations are implemented as standalone binaries that can be locally or remotely controlled by the management app. Visualizations are developed and distributed independently - using a hana SDK.

The intent is to create an open source library of visualizations, ready to use and easy to integrate into the system. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, with a focus on ease of use and performance.
## Inspiration
The hana system is meant to be pluggable and modular - drawing inspiration from the plugin system, modularity, simplicity and ease of use of [vcv rack](https://vcvrack.com) software as well as inspiration from bevy to make a management app that is as easy to use as a game.

## Goals and Use Cases
### High-Level Goals
- Enable seamless distributed visualization across screens, projectors and other devices connected to computers on a local network.
- Provide an intuitive 3D management interface.
- Support a wide range of input devices and control methods.
- Facilitate the creation and sharing of visualizations.
### Use cases
- Audio/visual installations both interactive and evolving/emergent
- Live performance incorporating real time improvisational control of visualizations
- Educational and artistic exploration of visualizations
- Fun
