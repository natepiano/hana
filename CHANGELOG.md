## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Restructured `OrbitCam` input configuration: flat touch/trackpad fields (`touch_enabled`, `touch_controls`, `trackpad_behavior`, `trackpad_pinch_to_zoom_enabled`, `trackpad_sensitivity`) replaced with `Option<InputControl>` containing `Option<TouchInput>` and `Option<TrackpadInput>` — set to `None` to disable all user input
- Animation events and types (`ZoomToFit`, `LookAt`, `PlayAnimation`, `CameraMove`, etc.) are now always available without requiring the `fit_overlay` feature
- Extracted internal types (`ButtonZoomAxis`, `TrackpadBehavior`, `UpsideDownPolicy`, `ZoomDirection`, etc.) as standalone public types

### Fixed
- Prevent panic when closing a second window
- Idle camera no longer triggers Bevy change detection every frame — `&mut Transform` is now only passed when the camera actually moves

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Pan, orbit, and zoom camera controls with smoothing, customizable sensitivity, and configurable key/mouse bindings
- Orthographic and perspective projection support
- Touch controls (one finger orbit, two finger pan, pinch zoom)
- Trackpad support with optional Blender-style orbit/pan/zoom mode
- Multi-viewport and multi-window support
- Render-to-texture camera support
- Optional `bevy_egui` feature to ignore input consumed by egui
- Optional `fit_overlay` feature: zoom-to-fit, queued camera animations, event-driven camera control (`ZoomToFit`, `LookAt`, `LookAtAndZoomToFit`, `AnimateToFit`, `PlayAnimation`), animation lifecycle events, conflict resolution, and debug overlay with gizmos and screen-space labels
