//! Events for camera animations and zoom operations.
//!
//! Events are organized by feature. Each group starts with the **trigger** event
//! (fire with `commands.trigger(...)`) followed by the **fired** events it produces
//! (observe with `.add_observer(...)`).
//!
//! # Common patterns
//!
//! **Duration** — several events accept a `duration` field. When set to
//! `Duration::ZERO` the operation completes instantly — the camera snaps to its
//! final position and only the **operation-level** begin/end events fire (see
//! [instant paths](#instant-operations) below). When `duration > Duration::ZERO`
//! the operation animates over time through [`PlayAnimation`], so the full nested
//! event sequence fires.
//!
//! **Easing** — events that animate also accept an `easing` field
//! ([`EaseFunction`]) that controls the interpolation curve. This only has an effect
//! when `duration > Duration::ZERO`.
//!
//! # Event ordering
//!
//! Events nest from outermost (operation-level) to innermost (move-level). Every
//! animated path goes through [`PlayAnimation`], so [`AnimationBegin`]/[`AnimationEnd`]
//! and [`CameraMoveBegin`]/[`CameraMoveEnd`] fire for **all** animated operations —
//! including [`ZoomToFit`] and [`AnimateToFit`].
//!
//! ## `PlayAnimation` — normal completion
//!
//! ```text
//! AnimationBegin → CameraMoveBegin → CameraMoveEnd → … → AnimationEnd
//! ```
//!
//! ## `ZoomToFit` (animated) — normal completion
//!
//! `Zoom*` events wrap the animation lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! ZoomBegin → AnimationBegin → CameraMoveBegin → CameraMoveEnd → AnimationEnd → ZoomEnd
//! ```
//!
//! ## `AnimateToFit` (animated) — normal completion
//!
//! No extra wrapping events — uses `source: AnimationSource::AnimateToFit` to
//! distinguish from a plain [`PlayAnimation`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! AnimationBegin → CameraMoveBegin → CameraMoveEnd → AnimationEnd
//! ```
//!
//! ## Instant operations
//!
//! When `duration` is `Duration::ZERO`, the animation system is bypassed entirely.
//! Only the operation-level events fire — no [`AnimationBegin`]/[`AnimationEnd`] or
//! [`CameraMoveBegin`]/[`CameraMoveEnd`].
//!
//! ### `ZoomToFit` (instant)
//!
//! ```text
//! ZoomBegin → ZoomEnd
//! ```
//!
//! ### `AnimateToFit` (instant)
//!
//! Fires animation-level events (to notify observers) but no camera-move-level events:
//!
//! ```text
//! AnimationBegin → AnimationEnd
//! ```
//!
//! ## User input interruption ([`CameraInputInterruptBehavior`](crate::CameraInputInterruptBehavior))
//!
//! When the user physically moves the camera during an animation:
//!
//! - **`Ignore`** (default) — temporarily disables camera input and continues animating:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   … (no interrupt lifecycle event)
//!   ```
//!
//! - **`Cancel`** — stops where it is:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   … → AnimationCancelled → ZoomCancelled (if zoom)
//!   ```
//!
//! - **`Complete`** — jumps to the final position:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   … → AnimationEnd → ZoomEnd (if zoom)
//!   ```
//!
//! ## Animation conflict ([`AnimationConflictPolicy`](crate::AnimationConflictPolicy))
//!
//! When a new animation request arrives while one is already in-flight:
//!
//! - **`LastWins`** (default) — cancels the in-flight animation, then starts the new one.
//!   `AnimationCancelled` always fires; `ZoomCancelled` additionally fires if the in-flight
//!   operation is a zoom:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   AnimationCancelled → ZoomCancelled (if zoom) → AnimationBegin (new) → …
//!   ```
//!
//! - **`FirstWins`** — rejects the incoming request. No zoom lifecycle events fire — the rejection
//!   is detected before `ZoomBegin`:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   AnimationRejected
//!   ```
//!
//!   The [`AnimationRejected::source`] field identifies what was rejected
//!   ([`AnimationSource::PlayAnimation`], [`AnimationSource::ZoomToFit`], or
//!   [`AnimationSource::AnimateToFit`]).
