# Undo System Architecture

## Overview
The undo system provides reliable undo/redo functionality across Hana's distributed 
environment while maintaining state consistency. It integrates with the [State Management](./state.md) 
and [Network Architecture](./network.md) systems to ensure synchronized operations across all peers.
## Core Principles
- Command-based undo system tracking discrete operations
- Network-aware operation history
- Memory-efficient storage of change history
- Clear user feedback about available undo/redo operations
- Preservation of causality in distributed operations
## Components
### Command System
- Each undoable operation encapsulated as a command
- Commands contain both forward and reverse operations
- Metadata for tracking command relationships and dependencies
- Integration with [State Management](./state.md) for version control
### History Management
- Per-session command history tracking
- Memory-bounded operation storage
- Command merging for composite operations
- History pruning based on relevance and age
- Network-wide history synchronization
### Network Integration
- Command propagation via [Network Architecture](./network.md)
- Consistency preservation across peers
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous operations
- History reconciliation after network partitions

### User Interface
- Undo/redo indicators in the hana [application](./application.md)
- Visual feedback for undoable operations
- Clear status for network-wide undo state
- History visualization for complex operations

## Command Categories

### Environment Commands
- Display group modifications
- Display positioning changes
- Window management operations
- Global property adjustments

### Parameter Commands
- Parameter value changes
- Modulation routing updates
- Input mapping modifications
- Plugin configuration changes

### System Commands
- Network configuration updates
- Plugin loading/unloading
- Resource allocation changes
- Global system settings

## Integration Points

### [State Management](./state.md) Integration
- Command versioning
- State validation pre/post undo
- History persistence
- Recovery mechanisms

### [Network Architecture](./network.md) Integration
- Command synchronization
- Operation ordering
- Conflict detection
- History reconciliation

### [Plugins](./plugins.md) Integration
- Plugin-specific undo operations
- State preservation
- Resource cleanup
- Version compatibility

## Limitations and Constraints
- Time-limited history retention
- Resource-intensive operation pruning
- Real-time parameter updates not individually undoable
- Network partition handling
- Plugin-specific undo limitations

## Error Handling
- Failed undo/redo recovery
- Network synchronization failures
- Resource exhaustion management
- Plugin state inconsistencies
- History corruption recovery
