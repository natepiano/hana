# Hana in Other Languages
Hana is a spiffy word for the name of a technical tool designed to support creativity.
Flowers are beautiful and inspirational. From a human perspective it's a
short word (4 chars) that is easy to type (each character alternates between the left
and right hand). Across many languages it can mean flower, happiness, grace, care in
arranging or positioning - all words that lend themselves to the purpose of the project.
Even in Finnish it refers to devices controlling the flow of water - a great metaphor
for the creative results Hana is meant to engender.
## Japanese (花, 鼻)
In Japanese, hana can mean either:
- 花 (hana) – “flower,” or
- 鼻 (hana) – “nose.”

They’re pronounced the same, but written with different kanji and have distinct meanings.
## Arabic
In Arabic, هَنَاء (transliterated as hanāʾ or sometimes just hana) means “happiness,” “bliss,” or “contentment.” It can also be used as a personal name, typically given to girls, carrying connotations of joy and well-being.
## Filipino/Tagalog
To place something with care; to position or arrange
## Finnish
“tap” or “faucet” - In everyday Finnish, hana refers to the device controlling the flow of water.
## Hawaiian
In Hawaiian, hana generally means “work,” “activity,” or “craft.” You may also encounter Hana as a place name (such as the area on Maui’s eastern coast).
## Korean (하나)
In Korean, 하나 (hana) is the native Korean word for “one.” It’s part of the traditional counting system (하나, 둘, 셋, 넷, 다섯 … for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 …). It is also sometimes used as a given name in Korean, often with the connotation of “one” or “unique.”
## Sanskrit (हन्, han + suffix)
In Sanskrit, the verbal root हन् (han) means “to strike,” “to kill,” or “to destroy.” While hana (हना) can appear in certain compound forms or older texts, it’s much more common to see derivatives such as:
•	हनन (hanana) – “killing,” “destruction,” or “the act of striking.”

So, if you encounter hana in a Sanskrit context, it is typically related to the root “han,” conveying the idea of striking, killing, or destroying.
## Other Language Notes
In many languages, Hana, Hanna, or Hannah is simply a personal name (often meaning “grace” when traced back to Hebrew).

Hana in various Romance and Slavic languages typically appears as a borrowing or a short form of Johanna, Anna, etc.

In some Polynesian languages related to Hawaiian, "hana" can also carry meanings connected to work, creation, or making, though the specific connotations may vary by island or region.
