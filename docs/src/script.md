# Script for a generative art and performance tool

Imaging this as a kickstarter video to get people to fund this project. A kickstarter video that raises a few million dollars.

## Script
Most creative software today—video editors, 3D modeling apps, DAWs, virtual synthesizers, and generative art tools—can feel complex and overwhelming. You've probably experienced it: hours spent clicking through menus, wrestling with interfaces, watching tutorial videos. Contrast that with the playful simplicity of games like "Tears of the Kingdom," where Link's UltraHand lets you intuitively combine and manipulate objects to build creations effortlessly. Or think of Iron Man's holographic interface, where Tony Stark arranges and uses digital elements with ease.

Now imagine bringing that cinematic simplicity and intuitive power into a real-world generative art and performance tool. Imagine it's as easy as playing a game with your friends.

This is Hana.

At its heart, Hana features the Node Editor—a 3D world where nodes float and align naturally in space. Effortlessly zoom in to interact closely with individual nodes or zoom out to capture the entire view of your creation.

Faces of nodes can be rotated to work with intuitive controls, inputs and outputs,  real-time visual feedback, statistics and your AI guide.

Connecting nodes are cables that visually come alive, automatically routing themselves beautifully and clearly illustrating the waveforms they contain. Each cable visualization can be expanded for deeper insight about the information that is moving through it - oscilloscopes for waveforms, tables for data, notes from a midi keyboard - letting you visualize this flowing data in its most useful form. Zooming out, the entire node world is visually engaging and suitable for real-world display.

The experience within Hana is inherently playful—selecting nodes is intuitive, responsive, and accompanied by delightful visual and audio cues.

Watch nodes emerge with particle effects, physics, and animations, making the creative process as rewarding as the end product itself.

Like Jarvis assisting Iron Man, Hana includes an integrated AI-powered guide built into every node—just ask the node itself how it works.

Hana can be played from devices such as MIDI controllers or sensors. Nodes can process external audio inputs, video feeds and data streams — transforming them into stunning visuals.

But Hana doesn't stop there. Imagine this creative environment isn't limited to just you. Borrowing from multiplayer gaming, Hana lets creators simultaneously work on a project. Collaborate in real-time and watch changes unfold instantly—something nearly impossible in traditional creative software and even if it were possible, it wouldn't be as fun.

And because the best performances need the perfect stage, Hana’s Environment Editor lets you effortlessly design your entire stage or installation. Position walls, screens, projectors, lights, lasers, and sensors exactly how they'll appear live.

This is creative software reimagined — cinematic simplicity meets creative collaboration.

This is Hana.
