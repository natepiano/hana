# Deployment System
## Purpose
There are a few areas covered under "deployment" - possibly this could be split into multiple sections
- [Management app](application.md) deployment onto a local system.
- Distributing the [Management app](application.md) across a network of peers.
- Updating the app to the latest version.
- Updating visualizations to the latest version.

## System Installation
