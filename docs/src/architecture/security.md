# Security Architecture

## Overview
Security model focused on peer-to-peer trust and plugin safety in local network environments. The system prioritizes secure machine-to-machine communication and plugin isolation without requiring user authentication infrastructure.
## Instance Security
### Peer Authentication
- Pre-shared key or certificate-based authentication between peers
- Simple trust establishment during initial setup
- Automatic peer discovery on local network only
- No persistent user accounts or credentials
### Trust Management
- Trust established at first connection
- Optional: ability to "forget" trusted peers
- Trust information stored locally per instance
- Simple mechanism to re-establish trust if needed
## Network Security
### Communication Security
- TLS/DTLS for all network traffic
- Certificate/key rotation policies
- Protocol-specific security for OSC/midi
- Local network isolation by default
### Access Control
- Firewall recommendations for local network setup
- Required ports documentation
- Rate limiting for network messages
- Protection against network flooding
## Plugin Security
### Sandboxing
- Resource isolation and limits
- Restricted filesystem access
- Network access controls
- Memory/CPU usage monitoring
### Plugin Verification
- code signing requirements
- Automated security scanning in plugin repository
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Version control and update verification
## Data Security
### State Data
- Encryption at rest for saved states
- Secure state synchronization between peers
- State modification only from trusted peers
- Audit logs for state changes
### Configuration Security
- Local configuration file protection
- Secure storage of peer trust information
- Data retention and cleanup policies
## Input Validation
### Parameter Validation
- Input sanitization for all parameters
- Type checking and bounds validation
- Rate limiting for parameter changes
- Malformed input detection

### Protocol Security
- OSC message validation
- midi message verification
- Custom protocol security measures
- Input rate limiting

## Monitoring

### Security Logging
- Basic security event logging
- Performance impact monitoring
- Optional: extended logging for debugging

### Incident Response
- Automatic peer disconnection on security violations
- Recovery procedures
- Simple incident reporting
