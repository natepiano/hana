# Undo System Architecture

## Purpose
The undo system provides reliable undo/redo functionality across Hana's distributed
environment while maintaining state consistency. It integrates with the [State Management](state.md)
and [Network Architecture](network_security.md) systems to ensure synchronized operations across all peers.
## Core Principles
- Operation-based undo system tracking discrete operations
- Network-aware operation history
- Memory-efficient storage of change history
- Clear user feedback about available undo/redo operations
- Preservation of causality in distributed operations
## Components
### Operation System
- Each undoable operation encapsulated as an Operation
- Operations contain both `apply`  and `reverse` methods
- Metadata for tracking Operation relationships and dependencies
- Integration with [State Management](state.md) for version control
### History Management
- Per-session Operation history tracking
- Memory-bounded operation storage
- Operation merging for composite operations (probably)
- History pruning based on relevance and age
- Network-wide history synchronization
### Network Integration
the idea is we want one view of the display environment regardless of which node we are on. and we should be able to undo operations on that node even if they happened on a different one.
- Operation propagation via [Network Architecture](./network.md)
- Consistency preservation across peers
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous operations
### User Interface
- Undo/redo indicators in [management app](application.md)
- Visual feedback for undoable operations (maybe)
- Clear status for network-wide undo state (maybe)
- History visualization for complex operations (maybe)

## Operation Categories

### Environment Operations
- Display group modifications
- Display positioning changes
- Window management operations
- Global property adjustments

### Modulation Operations
- Parameter value changes
- Modulation routing updates
- Input mapping modifications
- Module configuration changes (or node if that's what we call them)

### System Operations
- Network configuration updates
- Plugin loading/unloading
- Resource allocation changes
- Global system settings

## Integration Points

### [State Management](./state.md) Integration
- Operation versioning
- State validation pre/post undo
- History persistence
- Recovery mechanisms

### [Network Architecture](./network.md) Integration
- Operation synchronization
- Operation ordering
- Conflict detection
- History reconciliation

### [Visualization](./visualization.md) Integration
- Visualization-specific undo operations
- State preservation
- Resource cleanup
- Version compatibility

## Error Handling
- Failed undo/redo recovery
- Network synchronization failures
- Resource exhaustion management
- Visualization state inconsistencies
- History corruption recovery
