# Visualization Library
{{#include ../ai.md}}

## Purpose
The idea of this is modified after the VCV Rack 2 library system. It will be a web-based system that allows users to discover, download, and install visualizations. It will also allow developers to submit their visualizations for review and distribution.

Aspirationally a marketplace could be created where visualizations can be sold and purchased. In VCV Rack 2, the vast majority of modules are free/open source but a small number of higher end / higher quality modules are sold for $$. This could be a way to monetize the hana system and provide revenue opportunities for a hana community.

## Requirements
- Public, web-based registry for visualization discovery
- Version management and compatibility tracking
- Automated security scanning
- Distribution infrastructure
- User account management to keep track of which visualizations are in a user's library and allow for buying/selling visualizations
- Ability to download your library to a local system when you login.
- Ability to update local visualizations to a latest version.

## Visualization Lifecycle
### Development
1. Create visualization using SDK
2. Implement required interfaces
3. Test functionality and performance
4. Generate documentation
5. Submit to repository
### Distribution
1. Security scan and verification
2. Version compatibility check
3. Repository publication
4. Update notification to clients


### Verification
- code signing requirements
- Automated security scanning
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Version control and updates
