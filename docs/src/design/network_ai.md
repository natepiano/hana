## Purpose
Enables reliable peer-to-peer communication and display coordination across the hana network. Focused on network transport, topology management, and connection health.
## Core Responsibilities
- Peer discovery and connection management
- Reliable message transport (UDP/TCP)
- Connection health monitoring
- Network topology maintenance
- Basic failure detection
- Network diagnostics and metrics
## Network Transport Layer
### Message Delivery
- Reliable message delivery API for state propagation
- Message prioritization and ordering
- Delivery confirmation and retry logic
- Bandwidth management
- Latency optimization
### Connection Management
- Peer discovery and connection establishment
- Connection health monitoring
- Basic failure detection
- Reconnection handling
- Network topology updates
### Network Status
- Connection state tracking
- Peer availability monitoring
- Network health metrics
- Performance diagnostics
- Bandwidth utilization tracking
## Interfaces
### [State Management](./state.md) Interface
- Reliable message delivery API for state updates
- Peer status change notifications
- Network health status updates
- Connection event notifications
### Display Management Interface
- Display availability updates
- Display network status
- Connection quality metrics
## Failure Handling
### Connection Issues
- Connection loss detection
- Reconnection attempts
- Peer status updates
- Network topology updates
### Performance Issues
