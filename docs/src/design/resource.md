# Resource Management

## Purpose
The resource management system monitors and optimizes system resource usage across the hana network. It focuses on detection and reporting rather than direct control, working within bevy's constraints while providing useful insights and basic throttling capabilities.
## Caveat
This doc is really a pre-optimization. I think implementing monitoring of key measures and making them visible in the management app is a good start. From there we can choose which of these techniques would be interesting to tackle if it becomes important.

For now this is mostly aspirational
