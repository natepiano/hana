# Security discussions with Claude 3.5
{{#include ../misc/ai.md}}


## Purpose
Security model focused on peer-to-peer trust and visualization (downloadable binaries) safety in local network environments.

At this point these are all just ideas - we have not settled on the actual needs and approach for security yet.
## Instance Security
### Peer Authentication
- Pre-shared key or certificate-based authentication between peers
- Simple trust establishment during initial setup
- Automatic peer discovery on local network only
- No persistent user accounts or credentials - will this be true if, for example, we create an installation that needs to be secure but changeable by authorized users?
### Trust Management
- Trust established at first connection
- Optional: ability to "forget" trusted peers
- Trust information stored locally per instance
- Simple mechanism to re-establish trust if needed
## Network Security
### Communication Security
- TLS/DTLS for all network traffic
- Certificate/key rotation policies
- Protocol-specific security for OSC/midi
- Local network isolation by default
### Access Control
- Firewall recommendations for local network setup
- Required ports documentation
- Rate limiting for network messages
- Protection against network flooding
## Visualization Security
### Sandboxing
- Resource isolation and limits
- Restricted filesystem access
- Network access controls
- Memory/CPU usage monitoring
### Visualization Verification
- code signing requirements
- Automated security scanning in visualization repository
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Version control and update verification

## Input Validation
### Parameter Validation
- Input sanitization for all parameters
- Type checking and bounds validation
- Rate limiting for parameter changes
- Malformed input detection

### Protocol Security
- OSC message validation
- midi message verification
- Custom protocol security measures
- Input rate limiting

## Monitoring

### Security Logging(?)
- Basic security event logging
- Performance impact monitoring
- Optional: extended logging for debugging

### Incident Response
- Automatic peer disconnection on security violations - is this a security issue or just a network issue?
- Recovery procedures
- Simple incident reporting to management app

## Documentation

### Security Documentation
- Security architecture documentation
- Implementation guidelines
- Deployment best practices
- Regular security reviews
