# Hana Design Overview
These docs provide a high level overview and design of the hana system components. It id currently very high level and not an in-depth technical design document. As such it is acting more like a sometimes-technical requirements document.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Fast
- Smooth visualization previews and interface response in the management app
- Efficient network communication for streaming control data
- No lag or delays in visualizations seen by the audience
- Always put on the fast hat
### Easy
- Intuitive 3D manipulation in management app
- Clear modulation routing
- Easy configuration management
- Think through the user experience and how to make it as simple as possible to use while still providing robust capabilities
### Reliable
- Robust network handling
- Graceful failure recovery
- It would be better to have fewer features that work incredibly well than to make hana feature rich
