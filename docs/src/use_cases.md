# Use Cases

## phone control
everyone's phone is showing a piece of the visualization and the game is to get everyone to work together to show the visualization - possibly by arranging geometrically - or by dancing - or by.... by itself this could be a whole project

## van gogh
Get a warehouse
Get a bunch of projectors attached to machines running visualizations
Project on all walls, floors and ceilings
Hana takes care of mapping the image to the physical skybox of the room et voila - you're in outer space - or in the middle of a giant moving simulation

## kids fun
A visualization is merrily doing its thing and a child walks up to it and then the locus of attention/movement/complexity/whatever moves in front of the child and they can start interacting. Maybe the visualization responds to the child waving at it - or dancing in front of it - or whatever.

## vj
A DJ has visuals playing on a big screen. Typical. Atypical is that the DJ can use a keyboard or a modular synth or a dj controller to not only play the music but also play the visuals. Better than just a light show and it will help the DJ get even more involved in the performance.

## sphere
Get a few thousand hana machines together and you could make your own Las Vegas Sphere
