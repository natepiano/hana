# Use Cases

## generative art
think touchdesigner or artmatic - but much much much easier to use - you don't need a tutorial for every single operation

## live music
A band is playing live music and is projecting visuals onto a screen behind the stage. The keyboard player has hooked up their MPE keyboard to their laptop which is also running hana and controlling a visualization. With the MPE keyboard (such as a ROLI Seaboard), they can use pressure, velocity, sliding on the keys to control the visualization - rotating, zooming, panning, increasing or decreasing complexity, speeding up or slowing down, changing color, changing shape, changing texture, changing material, changing lighting changing everything. Individual keys can easily be mapped to visualization parameters to give full control over the visualization from a player on stage.

## vj
A DJ has visuals playing on a big screen. Typical. Atypical is that the DJ can use a keyboard or a modular synth or a dj controller to not only play the music but also play the visuals. Better than just a light show and it will help the DJ get even more involved in the performance.

## phone control
everyone's phone is showing a piece of the visualization and the game is to get everyone to work together to show the visualization - possibly by arranging geometrically - or by dancing - or by.... by itself this could be a whole project

## van gogh
Get a warehouse. Get a bunch of projectors attached to machines running visualizations. Project on all walls, floors and ceilings
Hana takes care of mapping the image to the physical skybox of the room et voil√† - you're in outer space - or in the middle of a giant moving simulation.

## kids fun
A visualization is merrily doing its thing and a child walks up to it and then the locus of attention/movement/complexity/whatever moves in front of the child and they can start interacting. Maybe the visualization responds to the child waving at it - or dancing in front of it - or whatever.

## sphere
Get a few thousand hana machines together and you could make your own Las Vegas Sphere
