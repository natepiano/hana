# Principles
## obsessive simplicity
The reason for hana's existence is to make easy what is difficult in creative software. We can't get rid of essential complexity - but we can make it easier to work with. We should always look for ways to make an interaction simple, obvious and intuitive.

## it just does what you expect
Many 2d vector drawing tools these days automatically show horizontal and vertical guides for positioning - including both for alignment and also for spacing. This is just expected - and the snap behavior associated with these guides is intuitive and easy to use. This is the sort of thing that we want to encourage in hana. Things generally work the way people expect them to. If there's a handle on a door, you pull it. If there's a flat plate, you push it.

## speed matters
Enough said

## details matter
For hana, we sweat the details. Cables should look real and hang naturally. Cable routing should be intuitive and look great.Cable jacks should be gold-plated and look like they belong on a real device.

## what's inside is reflected on the outside
The code structure should be clear and organized. APIs should be ergonomic. Names should be intuitive. I believe that beautiful code contributes to a beautiful hana.
