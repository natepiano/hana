# Themes
Themes could be created to provide different treatments for cables, nodes in the node editor, other ux elements. if you come up with a mechanism to allow them to be replaced at runtime. Or from the beginning you implement the ux elements as a wasm plugin that has to implement a particular API then a theme could be created that would replace the default...

You'd have to have some ability to test these plugin themes if you did it this way.
