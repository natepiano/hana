# Library

## node marketplace
As with VCV Rack modules, there will be a default set of nodes available with the app - but many nodes will be made by the community. The library is where you browse and install nodes. The library could just be a website that you log into in order to connect with what you have. And you can log into hana in order to access what you have already installed.

You can purchase nodes that are made available at a cost - hopefully that is a relatively small number compared to the hopefully majority that are open source.

## visualization marketplace
Groups of nodes that do something cool can be shared through the marketplace - or people can sell these as well.

## Logging into a new install
When you log into a new install every node you have marked as installed, and any that you have purchased will automatically download and install in the background. You can work with them locally as they become available.

We can show this clearly in the UI that they are greyed out in the node inventory until they are ready for use.

## environment marketplace
I'm not sure if this will be a thing or not - depends on how good we make the environment editor I suppose!
