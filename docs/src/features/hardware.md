# Hardware

We haven't really opened the hardware topic yet - but definitely we'll need to have an opinion.

## the ideal world
The ideal world would be that the environment editor has actual models for all the hardware devices that work with it. which would be insane for keyboard controllers as there are thousands at least - but still, it would be cool. At the very least it could have some models for preferred versions and generics for ones that it does not. And ideally it would be easy to add them and tag them with metadata.

## hardware to check out
### StreamDeck
StreamDeck is the device and BitFocus Companion unlocks all the power to control all kinds of devices and software - sort of reminds me of raycast actually
### Japanese LED light clothing
Remember that video of a Japanese designer that had cloth that was all addressable lights? Addressable by hana - especially for people in groups - would be amazing! Any LED clothing
