# Player
I suspect there will be a play only mode that allows you to control the things that you find most important for a live performance.

Anything that you've parameterized.

For inspiration think about Transit2 - Andrew Huang VST effect with Baby Audio. The big knob - super important.

And possibly the node editor would allow you to tag parameters to automatically show up in the player.  So you only interact with the things that are important to you.

And you can jump quickly back and forth between player and node editor so it is low friction to make a parameter available for the player

Have to think hard about this - in VCV rack you see everything all the time. Which can be both an avantage and also overwhelming. Omri Cohen, et al, have come up with mechanisms to create meta modules that allow for playing so you don't have to drown in the complexity of all of the controls.  but they do take work to configure - so if we automate this and make it "the player" that could be a key feature.
