# Displays
The first features to be implemeneted in Hana will be for visualizing on displays.

## Display Configuration
Probably in the environment editor you'll need to select one or more displays and arrange them physically. Whether side-by-side or stacked or in a grid - you can group them so they can work with a common visualization across all of them - or assign different visualizations to different displays.

## Visualization Assignment
Visualizations themselves are a kind of inventory so there will need to be an ability to quickly see all the possible visualizaitons - ideally with a running view of each of them so it's easy to choose what you want to assign.

## Visualization Control
While node editing allows you to parameterize nodes with external input (sensors, keyboards) - you should quickly be able to see what is controlling a visualization when it's assigned to a display. Maybe this controller information hovers around the edge. Maybe it's on the back of the screen. Maybe it's in a information panel at the bottom or side.

Given that playing the visualization is probably a vital thing if it's configured, it will be important to be able to make changes easily.
