Right now this section is a scratch pad for ideas of what hana could be. A wish list. A dream.

## above it all
The number one thing is to provide unreasonable hospitality to our friends, family and guests that use the app. Go above and beyond providing ease of use, speed and utility.

Right now an inspiration for me is canva - which I just started using and have been delighted again and again by the things they have thought through!

### quote from Will Guidara
Author of "Unreasonable Hospitality" from an [interview](https://www.econtalk.org/will-guidara-on-unreasonable-hospitality/#audio-highlights) with Russ Robert on EconTalk

Will Guidara: ...The point is, the way you do one thing is the way you do everything; and you can't decide which things you're going to choose to be intentional in pursuit of. Excellence is a hugely important part of creating a culture of unreasonable hospitality. Right? Like, it's a prerequisite to it.

Now, my entire thesis is that excellence is merely table stakes. Unreasonable hospitality is where you turn it from black and white into color. That's how you actually develop the kind of competitive advantage that is very, very lasting. But, the idea is that we strive for perfection. And then you need to realize that perfection is unattainable, and people choose to respond to that realization in one of two ways: They either stop trying or they try to get as close to it as anyone else has.

And, for me, it's just the idea that really excellence is thousands of little details executed perfectly. And when you stop thinking about perfection as a whole and instead break it down into all of its little parts, focusing on every single one of them with the same amount of rigor and discipline, you can get a lot closer to it than you think.
