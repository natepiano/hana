# Node Types

## windowed accumulator
As data is streaming in, provide a time window over which values accumulate (average, median, min, max, stdev, count, sum, product, variance, skewness, etc.) - which can then be surfaced at the output

## lfo
low frequency oscillator - sine, triangle, sawtooth, square, stepped random, noise, etc.

## midi
midi input - note on/off, cc, pitch bend, etc. - MPE and traditional

## bevy_verlet
https://crates.io/crates/bevy_verlet - this allows for a form of cloth-type geometry. If it could be applied as a node in some way, that would be very interesting

## points
https://crates.io/crates/bevy_points - interesting

## life
bevy_life simulation - a whole group of geometry or texture modifiers

## noise
perlin, voronoi (is that noise?) etc. - https://crates.io/crates/noisy_bevy
