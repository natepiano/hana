## group visualization
People could have a visualization playing across all of their phones - that would be a gee whiz fun trick to have multi-player hana player on your phone and based on how many people are in the room together, your phones would each display part of the visualization and you'd have to arrange them to see what it looks like all together...

## phone as node
could each phone be a node where they're collaboratively computing? I don't know if that makes sense. I bet latency would be too high but something to think about.
