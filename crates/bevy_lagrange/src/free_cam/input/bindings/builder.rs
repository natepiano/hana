//! Programmatic construction of [`super::FreeCamBindings`] plus the user-facing input-kind types
//! accepted by the builder.
//!
//! Types:
//! - [`FreeCamTranslateKeys`] — the six-key WASD/Space/Ctrl translate helper.
//! - [`FreeCamMouseLook`] — mouse-motion look binding gated by a mouse button.
//! - [`FreeCamTranslateBinding`] / [`FreeCamLookBinding`] / [`FreeCamRollBinding`] — per-action
//!   wrappers over a [`HeldBinding`] accepted by the builder's `.translate()` / `.look()` /
//!   `.roll()` methods.
//! - [`FreeCamBindingsBuilder`] — accumulates per-action [`HeldBindingDescriptor`]s and validates
//!   them into [`super::FreeCamBindings`].
