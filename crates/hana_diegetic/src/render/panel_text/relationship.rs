//! The panel↔run relationship: each text run carries [`TextRunOf`] pointing at
//! its panel; the panel carries [`PanelTextRuns`], the Bevy-maintained set of
//! its run entities.
//!
//! This is an additive typed index over the text-run subset of a panel's
//! children. The runs keep their `ChildOf(panel)` for transform propagation and
//! despawn; `TextRunOf` only narrows traversal to text runs, so a query never
//! has to filter a panel's [`Children`] by [`PanelTextLayout`](super::PanelTextLayout)
//! and the lone run of a one-element [`DiegeticText`](crate::DiegeticText) is
//! found with [`PanelTextRuns::sole`].
