//! run, including the single run of a one-element [`DiegeticText`](crate::DiegeticText)
//! label. `TextContent` is also the marker panel-text systems filter on
//! (`With<TextContent>`) to act on run entities; a panel root carries no
//! `TextContent`. The standalone world-text render path that once lived here was
//! removed when fluent text became one-element panels — all text now routes
//! through the panel-text pipeline.

//! The readiness signal ([`WorldTextReady`] + the `AwaitingReady` gate) is shared
//! infrastructure the panel-text path drives, kept here.
