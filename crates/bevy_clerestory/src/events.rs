///
/// After `try_apply_restore` completes, the library compares the intended restore
/// target against the live window state. If any field differs, this event fires
/// instead of [`WindowRestored`].
///
/// ## Sources
///
/// **Expected values** come from `TargetPosition`, which is computed
/// from the saved RON state file at startup. These represent what the restore *intended* to
/// achieve.
///
/// **Actual values** come from two live ECS sources, each chosen for accuracy:
///
/// - **`monitor_index`** → [`CurrentMonitor`](crate::CurrentMonitor) component, maintained by
///   `update_current_monitor`, which queries winit's `current_monitor()` and maps it to the
///   `Monitors` list. This updates quickly when the compositor moves the window.
///
/// - **`physical_position`, `logical_position`, `physical_size`, `logical_size`, `window_mode`,
///   `scale`** → the [`Window`](bevy::window::Window) component. Position and size reflect
///   `Window.position` / `Window.resolution`, and scale comes from
///   `Window.resolution.scale_factor()`. These lag behind the compositor because they only update
///   when winit fires corresponding events (`ScaleFactorChanged`, `Resized`, `Moved`). A common
///   mismatch is the scale factor still reflecting the launch monitor while `CurrentMonitor` has
///   already updated to the target monitor.
///
/// This intentional split means a mismatch signals that the window hasn't fully settled
/// — the compositor accepted the request but winit hasn't yet delivered all the
/// resulting state changes.
///
/// ## Field layout
///
/// The `expected_*` / `actual_*` pairs are deliberately flat rather than grouped into
/// nested comparison structs — the event is primarily consumed via reflection (BRP /
/// observers), where flat fields are easier to address than nested ones. The
/// `restore_window` example adapts this flat shape into nested `*Mismatch` types in
/// `examples/restore_window/events.rs`; any future reshape of the fields here must
/// update that adapter in tandem.
