//! Headless smoke run of the rigging kernel: two reporters push overlapping whole-set scans into
//! a live Bevy `App`, and the kernel merges them into one device set.
//!
//! The example registers an identity scheme, registers two `DeviceReporter` implementations, one
//! authored role binding, and one authored inventory entry, drives real frames until both reporters
//! have completed a scan, then reads the reconciled set out of `Devices` and the role's binding
//! entity and its live device link out of `BindingEntities`. It then provokes a departure by having
//! one reporter stop naming a key in a later complete scan, and prints the connection conclusion
//! that moves as a result. It touches no window, renderer, filesystem, or network.
