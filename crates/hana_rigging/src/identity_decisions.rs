//! The register of identity questions only a human can settle, and the answers that settle them.
//!
//! A reporter that claims a device-reported identity is claiming the value is stable for that unit.
//! When such a key later fails to match while a same-kind unit occupies the attachment the saved
//! one left, `crate::reconcile` concludes `crate::IdentityVerdict::Displaced` or
//! `crate::IdentityVerdict::WrongUnit` and records the debt in
//! `crate::IdentityDecisionOwed::HumanDecision`. Short of retiring the role, this module is the
//! only thing that discharges that debt; a unit carrying it undischarged is unusable, because both
//! authorization predicates reject it through `crate::IdentityVerdict::identified`.
//!
//! `IdentityDecisions` is where the question waits. A human answers many frames after the question
//! arose, from whatever system the application's interface runs in, so `IdentityDecisions::answer`
//! only *records* the answer: the kernel applies it in `adjudicate_identity_questions` during its
//! next `crate::RiggingSystems::Reconcile`. Everything a dialog needs to survive that gap follows
//! from it — a question is named by its role and its candidate `crate::DeviceKey` rather than by a
//! position in the list, and an answer whose question expired while the operator was reading it
//! resolves to `AdoptionOutcome::NoSuchQuestion` instead of panicking or silently doing nothing.
//!
//! A `crate::DeviceIdSource::Synthesized` key raises nothing here. A value that rotates on every
//! replug is not an identifier, and a reporter that synthesizes a key from stable evidence has
//! already made the decision this register exists for: the kernel takes the claim at face value,
//! answers `crate::IdentityVerdict::RestoreOnly`, and never asks the application anything.
