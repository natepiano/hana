//! Events the kernel emits on the edge where a reconciled fact changed.
//!
//! Every event here fires on a change edge and never on a settled frame, so a consumer can treat
//! one arrival as one transition instead of debouncing a per-frame restatement.
//!
//! # Which events exist, and why
//!
//! The list is derived from the state axes the kernel mirrors onto an entity, not accumulated one
//! case at a time: `crate::Presence`, `crate::Claim`, `crate::IdentityVerdict`,
//! `crate::RecoveryPolicy`, `crate::RoleState`, and attempt completion each have exactly one
//! event. A mirrored axis with no event, or an event with no mirrored axis, is the defect this
//! derivation exists to prevent.
//!
//! Each transition event carries only the state moved *to*. The state moved *from* is still on the
//! entity when an observer runs, so duplicating it in the payload would let the two disagree.
//!
//! # Two axes deliberately outside the derivation
//!
//! `crate::WaitingWork` is not on the binding entity and `crate::IdentityDecisionOwed` is not on
//! the device entity, so neither is mirrored. A consumer reading only entities or the Bevy Remote
//! Protocol therefore cannot see that a role owes a restoration or that a human owes an identity
//! decision; both are read from the resources instead — `crate::Bindings::waiting_work` and
//! `crate::ReconciledDeviceState::decision_owed`. This is stated rather than left implicit so that
//! surfacing either one is a decision somebody makes, not a hole somebody finds.
//!
//! `IdentityQuestionRaised` and `IdentityQuestionExpired` are that decision, taken for the identity
//! debt and for nothing else. Every other axis the kernel reports is state an application can read
//! whenever it gets around to it, whereas an identity question exists to make a human act, and one
//! that is never noticed leaves a device unusable. A consumer that only polls
//! `crate::IdentityDecisions` cannot see a question that arrived and expired between two reads, and
//! a dialog it opened has no signal that the entry vanished underneath it.
//!
//! # Why some events target an entity and some are global
//!
//! An event is an `EntityEvent` only when an entity is guaranteed to exist to receive it. A role
//! whose device has never appeared, or whose binding was retired in the same frame its attempt
//! ended, has no valid `Entity` to name — so those cases are global `Event`s carrying the durable
//! `crate::DeviceKey` or `crate::RoleKey` instead.
//!
//! Per-unit facts (`crate::Presence`, `crate::Claim`, `crate::IdentityVerdict`) target the device
//! entity; per-role facts (`crate::RoleState`, `crate::RecoveryPolicy`, attempt completion) target
//! the binding entity. The split is not stylistic: a device departure can despawn the device entity
//! while an attempt is still finishing, so an `AttemptFinished` aimed at the device entity would
//! have nowhere to land.
