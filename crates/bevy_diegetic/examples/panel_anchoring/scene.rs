//! Scene lifecycle: which capability is active, and the eased morph that carries
//! the one persistent tile set from one mode's layout to another's.
//!
//! Every capability shares a single set of [`AnchorTile`] entities, spawned once
//! at startup. Switching capability never despawns or respawns them: the anchor
//! and spin modes share the diagonal anchor fan, and the hinge chain is
//! the same tiles re-anchored edge-to-edge into a folding strip. A switch between
//! the fan and the strip arms a [`ModeMorph`]: the tiles keep their outgoing
//! relation, their [`PanelAnchorPose`] eases from the live pose to the pose that
//! reproduces the incoming layout, and only when the ease completes are the
//! relations re-pointed to the incoming mode — so the swap is invisible and the
//! tiles glide between layouts from any animation state.
