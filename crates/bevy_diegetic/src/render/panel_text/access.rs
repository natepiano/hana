//! Public get/set access to a panel's text runs.
//!
//! Two ways to address a run divide the public surface:
//! - **By user marker** — [`DiegeticTextMut`] retexts standalone
//!   [`DiegeticText`](crate::DiegeticText) labels: name a marker `M`, call `set`/`for_each_mut`. It
//!   traverses the panel→run relationship internally, the ergonomic path for "retext my labels".
//! - **By [`PanelFieldId`]** — [`PanelText`] is the read-write `SystemParam` for a named run on a
//!   multi-run panel; [`PanelTextReader`] is the read-only variant a reader system uses so it does
//!   not serialize on the `&mut DiegeticPanel` write claim.
//!
//! The id-addressed pair resolve a run through the panel's `id → Entity` index
//! ([`DiegeticPanel::text_child`]) and validate liveness via their
//! `PanelTextLayout` query, so a despawned run reads back as `None` rather than
//! a dangling `Entity` (TR-Q). The lone-run helpers ([`PanelTextReader::sole_text`],
//! [`PanelText::set_sole_text`], and [`DiegeticTextMut`]) resolve a label's run
//! through its [`PanelTextRuns`] set.
