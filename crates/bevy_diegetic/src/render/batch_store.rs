//! Shared batch-store primitives and render-family taxonomy.
//!
//! A batch member is one element's draw contribution. A batch groups members by
//! a GPU-compatibility key. A store routes members to batches and keeps the
//! member-to-batch index.
//!
//! Membership units differ by family:
//! - SDF: per record; an element contributes one record, or two when a clipped border splits fill
//!   and border.
//! - Image: per record, with one record per image.
//! - Text: per run; each text run owns its glyph quads.
//! - `ShapeBatch`: per `PanelShapeRenderKey` group. Groups are element-local, but `ShapeBatchStore`
//!   receives them per panel because `ResolvedPanelShape` records are re-derived from the panel's
//!   resolved command stream each route pass.
//!
//! [`BatchEntry`] and [`take_empty_batches`] apply to all four families.
//! [`BatchStore`] owns member routing for SDF batches, image batches, and
//! `TextRunBatchStore` text-run batches directly. `ShapeBatch` routing uses
//! [`BatchStore`] behind `ShapeBatchStore` because its source records
//! arrive panel-by-panel from the resolved command stream.
//!
//! `SdfMemberFamily` and `ImageMemberFamily` are the only [`MemberFamily`]
//! implementers; their `Store` associated types are `SdfBatchStore` and
//! `ImageBatchStore`. Those families update per-member world transforms after
//! `TransformSystems::Propagate` and then recompute batch bounds from retained
//! records. Text also writes post-propagation transforms, but
//! `write_batch_run_transforms` reaches `TextRunBatchStore` through `GlyphCache`,
//! so it stays concrete. `ShapeBatchStore` applies the panel transform while
//! building its `PathRenderRecord` runs.
