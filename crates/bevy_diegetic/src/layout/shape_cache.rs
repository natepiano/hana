//! Shared text-shaping cache keyed by `(text, TextMeasure)`.
//!
//! Stores two parallel maps:
//! - **measurements** — `TextDimensions` used by the layout engine's `MeasureTextFn`. This is the
//!   only half the headless layout path needs.
//! - **entries** — glyph runs from text shaping, reused by the renderer so parley shaping is not
//!   repeated after measurement has already happened.
//!
//! The cache is defined in `layout/` because its key and value types
//! (`TextMeasure`, `TextDimensions`) are layout-domain types and headless
//! panel layout depends on the measurement half. The renderer populates both
//! halves whenever it runs text shaping, so measurement lookups hit when
//! shaping has already run.
