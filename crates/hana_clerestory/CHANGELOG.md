# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed from `bevy_clerestory` to `hana_clerestory`. No API changes; update the
  dependency name and any `bevy_clerestory::` paths, including reflected
  `TypePath` strings in serialized scenes. Feature names are unchanged.
  `bevy_clerestory` 0.2.1 is a deprecated re-export shim and the final release
  under the old name.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- While the application remains running, its windows can now return to the same
  physical monitor after it is disconnected and reconnected. If the operating
  system moves a surviving window to another display, Clerestory can return it
  later. If Bevy deletes the window with the disconnected monitor, Clerestory
  can create one replacement `Window` on an available display and return that
  replacement when the monitor comes back.
- Opt a primary or managed window into reconnect handling by adding
  `WindowRecovery`. Clerestory waits until the window is associated with a
  verified monitor, then remembers that monitor until recovery is cancelled.
  Moving the window or changing/removing the component does not silently choose
  a new target.
- `WindowRecovery` provides three policies:
  - `Disabled` leaves the window outside reconnect handling.
  - `ApplicationControlled` notifies the application when the monitor
    disappears and returns. The application creates or selects the window and
    sends `RestoreWindow` when it is ready.
  - `FallbackAndReturn` tracks a surviving window on another display or creates
    a replacement window, then returns it automatically when the same verified
    monitor comes back.
- Clerestory restores the Bevy `Window` and its settings, but it does not clone
  application-owned cameras, UI, or other content. Applications attach that
  content when a replacement gains its `PrimaryWindow` or `ManagedWindow`
  component.
- `WindowRecoveryPending` reports that a registered monitor disappeared. For
  `ApplicationControlled` recovery, `WindowRecoveryAvailable` reports that it
  returned. Both identify the affected window with its stable `WindowKey`,
  which identifies the primary window or a named managed window across entity
  replacement. `RestoreWindow` names the replacement entity for an
  application-controlled restore.
  `CancelWindowRecovery` uses the stable key, so it still works after the
  original entity has been deleted; it keeps any surviving window where it is
  and stops automatic return.
- Physical monitor matching within one running application. When the operating
  system supplies enough identifying information, Clerestory assigns
  `MonitorIdentity::Verified(MonitorId)` and can recognize the same monitor
  after its Bevy entity or enumeration index changes. Otherwise the monitor is
  `Unverified`, and Clerestory does not guess from its connector, position, or
  index. A `MonitorId` is valid only in the current process and is never saved.
- `MonitorConnected` and `MonitorDisconnected` events report changes to the
  available monitors. Each event includes the affected monitor entity and a
  copy of its `MonitorInfo`; disconnect events retain the last known
  information after the entity is gone.
- `Monitors::iter()` returns `LiveMonitor` values containing each current
  monitor entity and its information. `MonitorTopologyRevision` changes when
  Clerestory installs an updated monitor inventory.
- Recovery notifications, monitor connection events, and restore results can
  be observed through the Bevy Remote Protocol (BRP) with
  `world.observe+watch`. BRP clients can send `RestoreWindow` and
  `CancelWindowRecovery` through `world.trigger_event`.
- The `restore_after_reconnect` example demonstrates both recovery policies,
  records an ordered diagnostic log, includes automated tests, and provides a
  two-cycle manual monitor-disconnect script.
- Linux monitors are now identified from `/sys/class/drm` when X11 reports no
  EDID: the kernel's EDID blob, or the connector name for built-in panels
  (`eDP`, `LVDS`, `DSI`, `DPI`), so they reach `MonitorIdentity::Verified`
  under XWayland and on EDID-less internal panels.

### Changed
- `MonitorInfo` gains an `identity: MonitorIdentity` field. Breaking for code
  that constructs `MonitorInfo` directly; existing field access is unaffected.
- `Monitors::list` is no longer public. Use `Monitors::iter()` for live
  monitor entities and information, or use the existing lookup methods. This
  breaks code that read or replaced the list directly.
- Monitor order and index lookup no longer use the position-sorted list from
  0.1.1. `first()` now returns the first monitor in Bevy's current winit
  enumeration order, which is not necessarily the primary or leftmost monitor.
  `by_index(i)` finds the monitor currently reporting index `i`; it is not the
  same as indexing a dense vector. Use `at()` or `closest_to()` for position,
  and `by_id()` for a verified physical monitor.
- The saved state file is read once during startup. Clerestory then keeps the
  current window state in memory and writes only after that state changes.
  While a window is waiting to return automatically, its saved placement stays
  unchanged until restoration finishes or the application cancels recovery.
- The saved state file moves to schema v3. A window position is stored as an
  offset from its monitor instead of an absolute desktop coordinate, and each
  entry records a fingerprint of the panel it was saved against — an EDID hash
  on Windows and X11, the ColorSync UUID on macOS — so the saved monitor is
  still found after a replug, dock, or driver update renumbers the displays.
  Where no panel evidence is available (Wayland, or a virtual display with no
  usable EDID) the entry stays anonymous and the saved monitor index is used,
  as in earlier versions. Unversioned, v1, and v2 files are still read and are
  migrated to v3 on the next save; a migrated coordinate is checked against the
  live monitor layout and discarded if it no longer lands on a display.
- Added a direct `winit` dependency (pinned to Bevy 0.19's version) to read
  platform-specific monitor identification data.

### Fixed
- A window with no saved position restoring onto a lower-density monitor was
  sized from the scale of the monitor it started on, so it returned at the
  wrong size and the restore never settled. Present in 0.1.1.
- macOS: a fullscreen restore waited without limit for a monitor move that
  winit never resolved, which could leave the window hidden.

### Verification
- Automated Bevy tests exercise the platform-specific recovery logic for
  macOS, Windows, X11, and Wayland. They cover surviving and deleted windows,
  application-controlled and automatic recovery, operation with no displays or
  no windows, cancellation, and platform capability limits.
- Real monitor disconnects still depend on operating-system behavior that a
  simulated test cannot prove. The example README contains one earlier macOS
  disconnect/reconnect record; the complete two-cycle macOS, Windows, X11, and
  Wayland results have not yet been recorded. Reconstructed windows may also
  return in a different front-to-back order because Clerestory does not
  preserve stacking order.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- Fix macOS automatic window tabbing merging same-app fullscreen windows into one tab group (blacking out the vacated monitor): `WindowManagerPlugin` now sets the app-wide `NSWindow.allowsAutomaticWindowTabbing = false` at plugin build, before any OS window exists

## 0.1.0 — Initial release

`hana_clerestory` (formerly published as `bevy_window_manager`).

- Multi-monitor support with scale-factor-correct positioning (mixed
  Retina / non-Retina setups).
- Correct placement when dragging across monitors with different scale factors.
- Platform workarounds: macOS, Windows, Linux X11 and Wayland.
- `Monitors` resource, `MonitorInfo`, `CurrentMonitor`, `ManagedWindow`,
  `ManagedWindowPersistence`, `WindowKey`, `Platform`,
  `WindowRestored` / `WindowRestoreMismatch` events.
- `WindowManagerPlugin` with `with_app_name` / `with_path` / `with_persistence`
