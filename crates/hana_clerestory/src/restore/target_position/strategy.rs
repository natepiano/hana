/// Restore strategy based on scale factor relationship between launch and target monitors.
///
/// # The Problem
///
/// Winit's `request_inner_size` and `set_outer_position` use the current window's scale factor
/// when interpreting coordinates, rather than the target monitor's scale factor. This causes
/// incorrect sizing/positioning when restoring windows across monitors with different DPIs.
///
/// See: <https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/4440>
///
/// # Platform Differences
///
/// ## Windows
///
/// - **Position**: Winit uses physical coordinates directly - no compensation needed
/// - **Size**: Winit applies scale conversion using current monitor's scale - needs compensation
/// - Strategy: `CompensateSizeOnly` when scales differ
///
/// Note: Windows has a separate issue where `GetWindowRect` includes an invisible
/// resize border (~7-11 pixels). See: <https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/4107>
///
/// ## macOS / Linux X11
///
/// - **Position**: Winit converts using current monitor's scale - needs compensation
/// - **Size**: Winit converts using current monitor's scale - needs compensation
/// - Strategy: `LowerToHigher` or `HigherToLower` depending on scale relationship
///
/// ## Linux Wayland
///
/// Cannot detect starting monitor or set position, so no compensation is applied.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - **`ApplyUnchanged`**: Apply position and size directly without compensation.
///
/// - **`CompensateSizeOnly`**: Windows only. Uses two-phase approach via `WindowRestoreState`:
///   1. Apply position directly + compensated size (triggers `WM_DPICHANGED`)
///   2. After scale changes, re-apply exact target size to eliminate rounding errors
///
/// - **`LowerToHigher`**: macOS/Linux X11. Low→High DPI (1x→2x, ratio < 1). Multiply both position
///   and size by ratio.
///
/// - **`HigherToLower`**: macOS/Linux X11. High→Low DPI (2x→1x, ratio > 1). Uses two-phase approach
///   via `WindowRestoreState` to avoid size clamping:
///   1. Move a 1x1 window to final position (compensated) to trigger scale change
///   2. After scale changes, apply size without compensation
