//! Hardware-free device reporting for `hana_rigging`.
//!
//! A `ScriptedReporter` replays a hand-written list of whole-set scans, so a test or an example can
//! make a device arrive, depart, change claim, or fail enumeration without any hardware attached.
//! Real hardware cannot serve this purpose: a runner cannot unplug a monitor on command, the
//! attached set differs per machine, and states worth testing — a duplicate key in one scan, two
//! reporters disagreeing about a capability, a unit swapped on the same port — cannot be produced
//! physically at all.
//!
//! The crate is built from `hana_rigging`'s public surface only and is never published. It lives
//! outside `crates/hana_rigging/tests` because each file there compiles to its own binary that
//! nothing else can depend on, while the consumers are other crates and another repository.
//!
//! `ScriptedDevice` exists rather than a bare `hana_rigging::DeviceRecord` for two reasons. A
//! record has nine required fields and no defaults, so every scripted scan would restate the four
//! evidence fields it does not care about; and `hana_rigging::Capabilities` holds
//! `Box<dyn Reflect>`, which Bevy 0.19 cannot clone, so a template that is replayed more than once
//! has to build its declaration on demand instead of holding one.
