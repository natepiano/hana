1. **Connection Management**
   - Handle premature shutdown - if it's user initiated, we should gracefully shutdown our own side of it - if it's not use initiated we should attempt to restart and reconnect n number of times before giving up
        - this can happen on either side
    - handle a situation where a visualization is running first and hana runs after - i suppose we need to stop automatically launching hana and instead allow it to possibly show the running visualizations and allow for it to be reconnected

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add unit tests for Endpoint message handling
   - Add integration tests for end-to-end communication
   - Create mocking strategy for network testing
   - Validate role-specific behaviors

3. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Document message type system
   - Add examples for common use cases
   - Document connection management behavior
   - Add comprehensive API documentation
   - Include role-specific usage examples

4. **Future Extensibility** (not implementing yet, just ensuring design supports)
   - Additional message types
   - Mesh networking between HanaApp instances
   - Status/telemetry from visualizations
   - Support for new roles and behaviors
