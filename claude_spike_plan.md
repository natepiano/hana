Hana Spike Plan
Overview
Building a minimal proof of concept for a Bevy-based visualization system with dynamically loadable plugins.
Core Requirements

Create a main Bevy application that can load plugins
Create a basic plugin interface that integrates with Bevy's plugin system
Create a simple example plugin with a 3D visualization
Demonstrate dynamic loading of plugin at runtime

Technology Stack

Rust (stable)
Bevy 0.15.1
Dynamic library loading (cdylib)

Implementation Plan

Create workspace and basic crate structure
Implement minimal plugin interface in hana-plugin
Create basic example plugin
Build main app to load and run plugin
Verify dynamic loading works

Files Needed

hana-plugin/Cargo.toml
hana-plugin/src/lib.rs (plugin interface)
examples/basic-plugin/Cargo.toml
examples/basic-plugin/src/lib.rs (example plugin)
src/main.rs (main application)

Next Steps

Set up project structure
Define minimal plugin interface
Create basic rotating cube example
Implement dynamic loading

Note: This is a minimal spike to validate core concepts. Many features and architectural decisions are intentionally deferred.
